# DonorConnect (Bondary CRM)

## What Is This?

**DonorConnect is a web app that helps nonprofits keep track of their donors and fundraising campaigns.** 

Think of it like a digital address book combined with a fundraising tracker. Instead of using messy spreadsheets or sticky notes to remember who donated, how much they gave, and when to follow up—this app does it all in one place.

### The Problem We're Solving

Nonprofits often struggle with:
- **Scattered information** - Donor details spread across emails, spreadsheets, and paper files
- **Generic communication** - Sending the same boring "thank you" to everyone instead of personal messages
- **No visibility** - Not knowing which campaigns are working or which donors might stop giving
- **Wasted time** - Hours spent manually tracking donations instead of building relationships

### Our Solution

DonorConnect gives you:
- A **central database** for all your donors and their giving history
- An **AI Writing Assistant** that helps write personalized thank-you letters and fundraising appeals
- **Visual dashboards** showing how your campaigns are performing
- **Email integration** to send messages directly from the app
